          <h3>Desktop Application</h3>
          <div class="description-box">
            <div><p>
              UW Coop Job Finder is a faster and better way to find Coop jobs on JobMine. Here are the frontend designs for this desktop application.
              <br> <br>
              NOTE: As of January 2017, JobMine has been deprecated by the new WaterlooWorks. This app is no longer functional due to the change of data source and data model.

          <h4>Workflow</h4>
          <div class="description-box">
            <div><p>
              User lands on login page. By default, login page leads user to the main weather screen where all the important details are disabled as explained in the next section. User can go to menu to access all the other pages. Menu can include weather screen, inventory screen, location screen, and profile screen.
            </p></div>
          </div>
          <h4>Job Postings</h4>
          <div class="description-box">
            <div><p>
              There are four main sections to the weather screen: daily section, hourly, weekly, and other items. 
            </p></div>

            <div><p>
              Daily section: contains details on current weather and items required. These items are the important ones that user configured for notification. Also includes time, date, location information. 
              <br><br>
              Hourly weather: graphical representation of the upcoming weather information. In addition, it shows what essential items should be brought out for hourly duration. If user wants to see a specific time in more detail, can click to update daily section. Time and date information will indicate what time period is currently selected
              <br><br>
              Weekly weather: displays weather details for the upcoming days.
              <br><br> 
              More items: These items are what user should consider bringing but not essential to their trip. These items will only be displayed if user opens application and will not notify user. 

            </p></div>

              A big feature of this application is giving users the power to configure when items will appear for the user. 
              <ol> 
                <li>Details of item is viewed. Includes weather conditions and the status of item (i.e. set to enable or notify). Underneath conditions is option to add more conditions. </li>
                <br>
                <li>To add condition, user must select specific weather conditions before adjusting the weather details.</li>
                <br>
                <li>User can search for weather conditions. Weather conditions that are not similar in occurrence will be disabled.</li>
                <br>
                <li>User can now adjust individual weather condition details.  There are 7 weather details available.</li>
                <br>
                <li>For each condition, user has a scale to indicate where they like the item to fall under. Depending on what weather condition as selected, some parts of the scale will be disabled (error checking). 
                </li>
              </ol>

              There were two main sets of icons created for this project: items icons and weather icons. 
              
              Item icons are categorized based on the type. The item icons will eventually cover almost all of the most commonly used item not limited to location.
