          <h3>Clothing Weather Mobile Application</h3>
          <div class="description-box">
            <div><p>
              Tusk is a mobile application that notifies the users to bring their essentials with them depending on the weather conditions. This project was developed by myself and a friend. We found that one of the main reasons why people check the weather is to plan for what to prepare for the day. We wanted to improve this preparation process by combining the two actions into one.

          <h4>Weather Screens</h4>
          <div class="description-box">

              There are four main sections to the weather screen: daily section, hourly, weekly, and other items. 
            </p></div>
            <img class="one-per-row description-img" src="Images/WeatherClothingApp/Display3Weather.png"/>

              <br><br>
              Hourly weather: graphical representation of the upcoming weather information. In addition, it shows what essential items should be brought out for hourly duration. If user wants to see a specific time in more detail, can click to update daily section. Time and date information will indicate what time period is currently selected
              <br><br>

              <br><br> 
              More items: These items are what user should consider bringing but not essential to their trip. These items will only be displayed if user opens application and will not notify user. 

            </p></div>
          </div>
          <h4>Adding Conditions</h4>
          <img class="one-per-row description-img" src="Images/WeatherClothingApp/Display2foursteps.png"/>
          <div class="description-box">
            <div><p>
              A big feature of this application is giving users the power to configure when items will appear for the user. 
              <ol> 
                <li>Details of item is viewed. Includes weather conditions and the status of item (i.e. set to enable or notify). Underneath conditions is option to add more conditions. </li>
                <br>
                <li>To add condition, user must select specific weather conditions before adjusting the weather details.</li>
                <br>
                <li>User can search for weather conditions. Weather conditions that are not similar in occurrence will be disabled.</li>
                <br>
                <li>User can now adjust individual weather condition details.  There are 7 weather details available.</li>
                <br>
                <li>For each condition, user has a scale to indicate where they like the item to fall under. Depending on what weather condition as selected, some parts of the scale will be disabled (error checking). 
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p></div>
          </div>
          <h4>Icons</h4>
         
          <div class="description-box">
            <div><p>
              There were two main sets of icons created for this project: items icons and weather icons. 
              <img class="one-per-row description-img" src="Images/WeatherClothingApp/Itemicons.png"/>
              Item icons are categorized based on the type. The item icons will eventually cover almost all of the most commonly used item not limited to location. 
              <img class="one-per-row description-img" src="Images/WeatherClothingApp/Weathericons.png"/>
              Icons can be in 3 states: disabled, enabled, or selected. The states of these icons are determined either when user manually selects the state or when that item/weather is restricted due to conditions. 
              <img class="one-per-row description-img" src="Images/WeatherClothingApp/Iconconditions.png"/>
