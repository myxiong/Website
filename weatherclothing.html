          <h4>My Role</h4>
          <div class="description-box">
            <div><p>
              This project was developed by myself and a friend on our own time. My role consisted of designing the front-end layouts and developing the clothing inventory feature. For the front-end layout, there were two essential views that were focused on: forecast/clothing suggestion display and the clothing inventory customization display. The two sets of displays shown above (comes in light and dark theme) are the formal mock UIs. I also worked on designing the icons and images done through Adobe Illustrator.  For the development of clothing inventory feature, I worked on the database used to store information each item with respect to weather API.
            </p></div>

          <h4>The Problem</h4>
          <div class="description-box">
            <div><p>
              A common problem for many people is forgetting essentials and not being prepared for the weather. For example, not bringing an umbrella for when it rains later in the day. A weather app is useful for those who are preparing for a particular event or trip but for those who check the weather on the daily may just want to use that information to decide what to bring with them for that day. We wanted to increase the efficiency of this process and to prevent people from forgetting to bring clothing articles and items.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In addition, different people own different items and are custom to different conditions so we also wanted to build an app that accommodate as many preferences as possible.

          <h4>The Design</h4>
          <div class="description-box">
            <div><p>
              The solution we came up with was a mobile application that is a weather app but also notifies users of items that they may want to bring for the rest of the day. I focused on high level ideas for the features of the two important screens: the weather view and the clothing inventory view. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The functionalities of the weather view must contain the display for current weather, display progression of hourly weather, display for weekly weather, and display for items recommended to bring. In particular, the hourly weather requires a graphical representation to compare the difference in temperature throughout the day. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The functionalities of the clothing inventory view must contain the display of the item, enable and notification switch, and customization of weather conditions. The enable and notification is useful because it allows the users to determine if the item should be suggested at all and as well as if they want to be notified. The customization gives the users to tailor specific weather conditions to an item within a certain range.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As I was in charge of the front-end design, I wanted something simple and intuitive, easy to use for the user. The mock UI displays the simplicity of the design. It is offered in two themes, light and dark. Certain themes are better for certain environment settings (i.e. light theme for brighter days and dark theme for darker days).
