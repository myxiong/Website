          <h3>Web Application and Arduino Demo</h3>

              This application allows users to control home appliances throughout the household. It contains information of each room and its respective appliances in the house. The original application was demoed as a web application that integrated with an Arduino board to mockup home appliances at the Western Hackathon. The following contains the revised version of the application after the hackathon.

          <h4>My Role</h4>
          <div class="description-box">
            <div><p>
              The original concept was developed and designed during Hack Western hackathon by myself and four other group members. My role during this hackathon was focused on the front-end web development and the integration of the web app to the Arduino demo. After Hack Western, I decided to polish the idea and the UI/UX of this application.

          <h4>The Problem</h4>
          <div class="description-box">
            <div><p>
              Many appliances around the house can only be used when someone is present. However, that introduces many problems with time efficiency, productivity, and even safety. For example, preheating the stove requires someone to be there or else it would be a safety hazard. Or perhaps preparing for a hot shower. That not only requires someone else to be present but as well as energy wasted while waiting for the water to turn hot. There are also cases when leaving the house and to only later you discovered that you left the lights or even worse, the stove on. Many of these problems exist because of the lack of control people have over their appliances from a remote location.

          <h4>The Design</h4>
          <div class="description-box">
            <div><p>
              The solution we provided for this was an application that uses IOT to control appliances around the home. The design for this application at Hack Western was a web application that displayed generic switches for lights, fan, and temperature. The web application was connected to an Arduino for demonstration purposes. Different components (i.e. the LEDs and motor) represented different features around the house. Using the web application, it was capable of controlling the components on the Arduino.

              After Hack Western, I polished the design into a mobile application.  It is more practical since remote automation is targeted those who are on the go. For every room in a house, there is a view for appliances and controls. The details and settings of the controls are listed at the bottom. At the top displays the current time, temperature, and appliances in that room. Certain appliances are highlighted if currently in use.
